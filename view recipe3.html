<h3>Steps to prepare the recipe:</h3>
<td>
    Step1:
    Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F 
    (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.

    step2:
    Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and 
    let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. 

    Step3:
    Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until
     smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted 
     with a dough hook to make it easier. 

    step4:
    Let rest for 5 minutes.

    step5:
    Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or
     roll into a 12-inch circle.
