<h3>Steps to prepare the recipe:</h3>
<td>
    step1:
    Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.

    step2:
    Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.

    step3:
    Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. 

    step4:
    Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.

    step5:
    Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to 
    desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at 
    least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
