<h3> Steps to prepare the recipe:</h3> 
<td>
    Step 1:
    For the sauce: 
    Bring orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, orange zest, 
    and lemon zest to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat 
    to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove 
    from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to cool.

    Step 2:
    For the salad: Layer fruit in a large, clear glass bowl in this order: 
    pineapple, strawberries, kiwi fruit, bananas, oranges, grapes, and blueberries.
    Pour cooled sauce over fruit; cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours before serving.
